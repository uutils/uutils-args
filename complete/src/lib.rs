//! Generation of completion and documentation
//!
//! All formats use the [`Command`] struct as input, which specifies all
//! information needed. This struct is similar to some structs in the derive
//! crate for uutils-args, but there are some key differences:
//!
//!  - This is meant to be more general.
//!  - Some information is added (such as fields for the summary)
//!  - We have [`ValueHint`] in this crate.
//!  - Some information is removed because it is irrelevant for completion and documentation
//!  - This struct is meant to exist at runtime of the program
//!
